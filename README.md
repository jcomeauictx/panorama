This is a JavaScript port of my [curvature](https://github.com/jcomeauictx/curvature/) project, to make it more accessible to the nonprogrammer, and to compete
with Ulrich Deuschle's closed-source [panorama generator](http://www.udeuschle.selfhost.pro/panoramas/makepanoramas_en.htm). It still needs a lot of work, but the basic equirectangular plot is done.
