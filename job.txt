port the code from ../gdavis or /usr/src/jcomeauictx/curvature to JavaScript,
either using a client/server mechanism, Chrome extension, or something else.

chrome extension is problematic in that it doesn't run in the page itself,
so console.log doesn't go to the page's console, objects created also aren't
visible on page. maybe better client/server.
